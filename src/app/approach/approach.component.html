<h3>Approach</h3>

<p>I follow an iterative work-flow by having a minimal viable product. For the website I use the approach below.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Have an idea.</li>
    <li>Define requirements through MoSCoW.</li>
    <li>Optionally draw UML diagrams or sketches.</li>
    <li>Implement the (sub)requirements one by one.</li>
    <li>
        Review the result.
        <ol>
            <li>Review by others, increases quality.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
